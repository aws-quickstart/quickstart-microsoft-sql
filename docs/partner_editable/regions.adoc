This deployment includes AWS Secrets Manager, which isn’t supported in all https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS Regions^]. For a current list of supported Regions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/asm.html[Service Endpoints and Quotas] in the AWS documentation. Also, if you’re planning to deploy an architecture with three Availability Zones, choose an AWS Region that supports three Availability Zones.

If using nondefault settings, including dedicated hosts for the SQL servers and an FSx file share for the file-share witness, see the AWS documentation to ensure regional compatibility.
